# ACS

ACS is a sample project consisting of a Web API, a service library, and a SQL Server database project. It demonstrates a basic .NET 8 solution structure.

See the documentation in the `docs` folder for details about the architecture and how to run the service.
For local development, run `scripts/setup_dotnet.sh` to install the required .NET SDK if it is not already available.
