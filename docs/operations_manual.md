# Operations Manual

This section covers deployment and day-to-day operations of the service.

## Deployment
Deploy the Web API and service projects together. The database project can be built to generate a SQL script that initializes tables and seed data.

## Monitoring
Use standard ASP.NET Core logging and any infrastructure monitoring of choice to keep track of service health.

## Maintenance
Database schema changes should be applied using the SQL project. Code changes should follow the guidelines in the Developer Guide.
