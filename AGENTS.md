# Agent Instructions

- Refer to `docs/projects/index.md` for all active projects.
- When a user request relates to one of these projects, mention the project and
  update the corresponding file if necessary.
- Inform the user if their request affects any current projects.
- Keep **all** documentation up to date. Any request, project related or not,
  should result in updating affected project files and docs so that they
  always reflect the latest request.
