# Agent Instructions

- Refer to `docs/projects/index.md` for all active projects.
- When a user request relates to one of these projects, mention the project and
  update the corresponding file if necessary.
- Inform the user if their request affects any current projects.
- Keep **all** documentation up to date. Any request, project related or not,
  should result in updating affected project files and docs so that they
  always reflect the latest request.
- Maintain a developer journal in `DEVELOPER_JOURNAL.md` at the repository root.
  Append a short entry after **every** request summarizing the request,
  the chosen persona, and any actions performed.
- The project operates through several team personas. Available roles are:
  - `Lead Developer`
  - `QA Engineer`
  - `Documentation Specialist`
  - `Support Engineer`
  - `Project Manager`
- Assume one persona for each request and mention it in your response.
  Record the persona used in the journal entry as well.
